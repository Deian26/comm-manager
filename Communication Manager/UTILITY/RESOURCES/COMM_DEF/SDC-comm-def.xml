Serial Device Communication
Protocol defined for communication with an IoT device. 
The device must support the protocol.

    <interface type="Serial" resource-type="COM"/> <!-- **resource-type** must be one of the supported ports; currently only **COM** is planned-->
    
    <frame break-time-ns="100"> <!-- format of the packet to be sent/received; each sub-node defines a field from the frame, in the order it must be found in the actual frame; **break-time** specifies how many ns to wait after sending a frame (int)-->
        <!--
		SDC frame format:
		
		   ID	       MetaData	       Length	               Data
		[1 byte]       [1 byte]	      [2 bytes]	      [max 6536 (0xFF FF) bytes]
		
		
		The 'MetaData' field contains the following values:
			Flags:
				Bit 7 : EoF (1 if the current frame is en EoF frame)
				Bit 6 : StartMultiFrameData (1 if this is the first frame from a multi-frame transmission; must be set to 0 starting with the second frame)
				Bit 5 : MultiFrameData (1 if the current frame is part of a multi-frame transmission, but not the first sent frame)
				Bit 4 : DiscardData (if 1, the data in the last frame shall be discarded; if this is sent during or after a multi-frame transmission, the entire multi-frame data shall be discared by the receiver)
				Bit 3 : Priority (if 1, the current frame is of high importance; the receiver shall implement application-specific behaviour for this flag)
			
			Parity:
				Bit 2 : DataParity (1 = odd, 0 = even number of '1' bits in Data)
			
			Bit 1 : Reserved
			Bit 0 : Reserved
			
		Any transmission ends when a frame with:
			ID = 0xFF
			MetaData = 0x80 (bit 7 = 1, bits 0-6 = 0)
			Length = 0x00
			[no Data field sent]
		is detected.
